# Go by example
I'm just working through the examples at [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/) by Mark McGranaghan and Eli Bendersky. Here's a link to their [license](https://github.com/mmcgrana/gobyexample#license) I probably won't do the whole thing, and any mistakes are my own. When I'm done this will be a little portable library of code snippets.
